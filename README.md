# Podcast Player with less distractions

The objective of this project is to create a podcast player with the most streamlined ui, for everyday use. 
It should take no more than three clicks to start an episode. The audio player should always be full screen and easy
to seek, pause and play. 

### TODOs 

In no particular order

 - Better UUID support to detect duplicate podcasts
 - Export/Import features
