# A Bespoke and Playful Podcast Player Project

This development of this project is meant to explore a large number of android patterns and is
therefore necessarily not uniform in its approach.

The objective of the podcast player is to have the most streamlined ui, for everyday use.
It should take no more than three clicks to start an episode.
The audio player should always be full screen and easy to seek, pause and play.
